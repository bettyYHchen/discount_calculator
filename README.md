#A tested discount calculator
In the file discount_calculator.py, there is a function called calulate_discount that takes three arguments:
* item_cost: the price of an item
* relative_discount: a percentage to remove from the item cost
* absolute_discount: an additional fixed discount which should be applied to the item
For example, discount_calculator(200.0,10.0,30.0) should return 150.0.

The file test_discount_calculator.py tests the calculator in 8 possible cases.
